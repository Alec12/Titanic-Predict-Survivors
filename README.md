# Titanic-Predict-Survivors

This notebook practices on the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster dataset on Kaggle.com

I plan to 
1) investigate the data with Exploratory Analysis, using visualizations to better understand attribute trends
2) improve model traction with Feature Engineering
3) create a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survives or not, aboard the Titanic.
